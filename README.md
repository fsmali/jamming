# Spotify Playlist Manager

A web application to search for songs and manage playlists on Spotify.

## Project Description

This project is a Spotify Playlist Manager, a web application that allows users to search for songs or artists, add them to a playlist, name the playlist, and save the playlists directly to their Spotify account.

### What Your Application Does

- **Search for Songs or Artists**: Users can search for their favorite songs or artists using the search bar.
- **Create and Manage Playlists**: Users can add songs to a playlist, name the playlist, and save it to their Spotify account.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The application provides real-time updates as users add or remove songs from their playlists.

### Why You Used the Technologies You Used

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering using the virtual DOM, which makes it ideal for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Spotify Web API**: Utilized to fetch song data and manage user playlists, leveraging its robust API to interact with Spotify's vast music library.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the Spotify API due to its simplicity and ease of use.
- **React Toastify**: Implemented for user notifications to provide feedback for actions like saving a playlist or handling errors.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhancing the application's responsiveness to ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.

### Challenges You Faced and Features You Hope to Implement in the Future

- **Challenges**:
  - **Authentication**: Managing OAuth 2.0 flow with Spotify was initially challenging, especially handling the authorization code and exchanging it for an access token.
  - **API Rate Limiting**: Dealing with rate limits imposed by Spotify's API required implementing retries and handling errors gracefully.
  - **UI/UX Design**: Designing a user-friendly interface that matches Spotify's aesthetics while ensuring intuitive interactions.

- **Future Features**:
  - **Song Previews**: Integrating audio previews for songs so users can listen before adding them to their playlist.
  - **Advanced Search Filters**: Implementing filters to allow users to search by genre, album, or release date for a more refined search experience.
  - **Song Previews**: Integrating audio previews for songs so users can listen before adding them to their playlist.
